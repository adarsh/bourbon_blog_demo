Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter. Operation Hot Mother. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. You just made a fool out of yourself in front of T-Bone.

####A Hundred George Michaels
If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! Are you aware of this? Coming soon. Indeed. Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist. The world's first analrapist. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror. ♪♪ And the thought of rubbin' you is getting so exciting. Sky rockets in flight! Afternoon delight! ♪♪

Uncle Gob, was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. Yes, she happens to be more experienced than a normal girl, but sometimes love should be… terrifying. It's as Ann as the nose on plain's face.
