#Mission Accomplished
She calls it a mayonegg. I've been in the film business for a while but I just cant seem to get one in the can. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot… your wife is dead! Are you aware of this? Coming soon. Indeed. NO TOUCHING! My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer.

Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. Of course. The "Bob Loblaw Law Blog." Wow. You, sir, are a mouthful! I've made a huge tiny mistake. I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run..so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands.
